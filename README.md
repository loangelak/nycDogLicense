Active Dog Licenses during 2016.

All dog owners residing in NYC are required by law to license their dogs. The data is sourced from the <a href='https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/DogLicense'>DOHMH Dog Licensing System</a>, where owners can apply for and renew dog licenses. Each record represents a unique dog license that was active during the year, but not necessarily a unique record per dog, since a license that is renewed during the year results in a separate record of an active license period. Each record stands as a unique license period for the dog over the course of the yearlong time frame.
