Active Dog Licenses during 2016.

All dog owners residing in NYC are required by law to license their dogs. The data is sourced from the <a href='https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/DogLicense'>DOHMH Dog Licensing System</a>, where owners can apply for and renew dog licenses. Each record represents a unique dog license that was active during the year, but not necessarily a unique record per dog, since a license that is renewed during the year results in a separate record of an active license period. Each record stands as a unique license period for the dog over the course of the yearlong time frame.

# ABOUT NYC PET LICENSING

New Rules in Effect: Pet dogs are now allowed in some outdoor dining areas with restrictions. Read the Dining with Dogs law (PDF).

New York State law mandates that all dog owners license their dogs.  All dogs residing in NYC must have a license tag visibily attached to the dog from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.  Licenses must be renewed annually. Failure to do so may result in local fines. 

A dog license costs $8.50 per year for spayed or neutered dogs or $34 per year for non-spayed or neutered dogs. Dog licenses may be purchased or renewed for one to five years. All dog license fees are non-refundable.

You can apply for a New York City dog license or <a href='https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/DogLicense/'>renew an existing license online</a>.
